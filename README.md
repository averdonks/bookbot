# Bookbot ðŸ“˜ 

Bookbot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project! 
It is a Python program that analyzes novels in `.txt` format and prints a statistical report featuring:
- Word count
- A list of characters and their count

## Installation

1. Either clone this repository or download it as ZIP and unzip
2. Within the project directory (`bookbot`), create a directory called `books` and add the book(s) you would like to analyze  

## Usage 

To use Bookbot, you must provide a path to your book file when executing `main.py`:

```bash
$ python3 main.py <path_to_book>
```

## Example 

```bash
$ python3 main.py books/mobydick.txt
